/*
Given a m*n grid with each cell consisting of a positive, negative, or zero integer.
We can move across a cell only if we have positive points. Whenever we pass through a cell,
points in that cell are added to our overall points, the task is to find minimum initial points
to reach cell (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0) by following these certain set of rules :
1. From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1).
2. We cannot move from (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) are <= 0.
3. We have to reach at (n-1, m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.
