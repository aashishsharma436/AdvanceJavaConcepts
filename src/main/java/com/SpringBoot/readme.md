## Spring
- Spring is an open-source lightweight framework widely used to develop simple, reliable and scalableenterprise Solutions.
- The most important feature of the spring is dependency injection.
- It helps us to create a loosely coupled application.
- To run spring application, we need to set the server explicitly.
- To run spring application, a deployment descriptor is required.
- It does not support for an in-memory database.
- Developers have to define dependencies manually in the pom file.

## SpringBoot
- SpringBoot is built on the top of the conventional spring framework, widely used to REST API's
- It provides all the features of Spring and is easier to use than spring.
- SpringBoot is a microservice-based framework and makes production ready applications in very less time.
- It allows us layered architecture in which each layer communicates to other layers.
- The most import feature of spring boot is autoconfiguration.
- It helps to create a standalone application.
- SpringBoot provides embedded servers like tomcat and jetty.
- There is no requirement for a deployment descriptors.
- It provides support for an in-memory database such as H2.
- pom file internally handles the required dependency.

## Spring Boot layers
- ### Presentation layer
  - It's a top layer of spring boot architecture.
  - It consists of views, i.e., the frontend part of the application.
  - It handles HTTP requests and performs authentication.
  - It is responsible for converting the JSON fields parameter to a java object and vice versa.

- ### Business layer:
  - It contains all business logic.
  - It consists services of classes.
  - It is responsible for validation and authorization.

- ### Persistence layer:
  - It contains all the database storage logic.
  - It is responsible for converting businees object to the database row and vice versa.

- ### Database layer:
  - The DB layer contains all the databases such as MYSQL, MONGODB, etc.
  - The layer contains multiple DB.
  - It's responsible for CRUD operations.

## Spring Boot Actuator
- It is used to monitor and manage your spring boot application.
- By /actuator and /actuator/heath endpoints you can achieve the above goals.
- You can change the default endpoint by adding the following in application.properties file
  - management.endpoints.web.base-path = /details
- ### Advantages
  - It increases customer satisfaction
  - It reduces downtime.
  - It boosts productivity.
  - It improves Cybersecurity management.
  - It increases the conversion rate.

## Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) Container
- It is the core of spring framework.
- It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependency, managing their entire lifecycle.
- The container uses dependency injection to manage the components that make up the application.
- It gets the information about the object from the configuration(XML file) or java Annotations and java POJO classes.
- These Objects are called Beans.
- **There are two types of IOC containers.**
  - ### Bean Factory:
    - Bean factory loads the bean definations and dependency among bean based on a configuration file (XML) or the beans can be directly accessed when required using java configuration.
    - Bean factory does not support annotation bases configuration.
    
  - ### Application Context:
    - It is a sub interface of Bean Factory.
    - It is used when we are creating an enterprise level application or web application.
    - This uses all these types of configurations.
      - AnnotationConfigApplicationContext container
      - AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext container
      - XmlWebApplicationContext Container
      - FileSystemXmlApplicationContext Container
      - ClassPathXmlApplicationContect Container

## Dependency Injection
- It is a programming technique in which an object or function receives other objects or functions that it requires, 
- as opposed to creating them internally. Dependency injection aims to separate the concerns of constructing objects and using them, leading to loosely coupled programs.
- It can be done via 2 types
  - **Constructor Dependency Injection:** the container will invoke a constructor with arguments each representing a dependency we want to set.
    - ```java
      @Configuration
      public class AppConfig {
    
          @Bean
          public Item item1() {
              return new ItemImpl1();
          }
    
          @Bean
          public Store store() {
              return new Store(item1());
          }
      }
      ```
  - **Setter Dependency Injection**
    - the container will call setter methods of our class after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method to instantiate the bean. Letâ€™s create this configuration using annotations
    - ```java
      @Bean
      public Store store() {
          Store store = new Store();
          store.setItem(item1());
          return store;
      }
      ```

| Poor Reliability                                                                                                                                                  | Good Reliability                                                                                |
| The bean must include the getter and setter methods for the properties                                                                                            | The bean clas must declare a matching constructor with arguments otherwise Bean creation exception will be thrown |
| Requries Addition of @Autowired Annotation above the setter in the code, hence it increases the coupling between the class and the Dependency injection container | Best in the case of loose coupling                                                              |
| Circular dependency or partial dependencies result with setter dependency injection because object creation happens before the injection                          | No scope for circular dependecy because dependencies are resolves before object creation itself.|
| Preferred option when properties are less and mutuable objects can be created                                                                                     | Preferred option when properties on the bean are more and immutable objects are important for application|

  - The bean must include the getter and setter methods for the properties
